cimple
- Sean Brown -

There is a Makefile included in this directory. Running make will generate an executable binary called "exec."

to run exec, supply it with the following:
1) a "cimple" code file to be read
2) a list of tags indicating which visitors you want to run after parsing

Currently supported tags are:
-id                 The identity visitor, which prints the class name of each node in the AST as it is visited
-pp                 The Pretty Print visitor, which prints the AST in the same format as acceptable code
-list               The Listify visitor, which flattens the AST so that lists of nodes are contained in a single list node
-st                 The Symbol Table visitor, which generates and prints a symbol table
-tc                 The Type Check visitor, which verifies the types are correct
                        This is effectively -list -st -tc, as it will flatten the AST and generate a symbol table before performing the type check
-v                  When used immediately after -tc, this tag will print out a verbose report of the type check
-cesk               Performs -tc, and then interprets the file given

There is a file named "cample" that can be used to test the execution of "exec".
All files included for testing purposes have the extension ".cim"

ValidType.cim, InvalidType.cim, and InvalidType2.cim can all be used to verify the correctness of the Type Checker.

interptest1.cim, interptest2.cim, and interptest3.cim all verify correcness of te interpreter. Further details about what they test can be found in comments for the given files.

Example run:

./exec cample.cim -list -pp

- Known Issues - 
When printing a string in interpretation, the quotes are not stripped off. e.g. printstring("hello") will print "hello" instead of hello.
