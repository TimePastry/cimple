cimple
- Sean Brown -

There is a Makefile included in this directory. Running make will generate an executable binary called "exec."

to run exec, supply it with the following:
1) a "cimple" code file to be read
2) a list of tags indicating which visitors you want to run after parsing

Currently supported visitor tags are:
-id                 The identity visitor, which prints the class name of each node in the AST as it is visited
-pp                 The Pretty Print visitor, which prints the AST in the same format as acceptable code
-list               The Listify visitor, which flattens the AST so that lists of nodes are contained in a single list node
-st                 The Symbol Table visitor, which generates and prints a symbol table

There is a file named "cample" that can be used to test the execution of "exec".

Example run:

./exec cample -list -pp
